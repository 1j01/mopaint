# Mopaint

Mopaint is a sort of rewrite of [JS Paint]
on more solid foundations (e.g. [React] instead of jQuery, [Webpack] instead of a bunch of scripts, probably [Redux]... instead of just mutable global variables),
without the limiting factor of being first and foremost a recreation of MS Paint from Windows 98,
where I plan to implement things that I feel would be too difficult to implement in that codebase,
starting first with collaborative image editing.

I want it to be a modern, modular, multiplayer painting app, and more.

I may backport some things to JS Paint, and may eventually rewrite JS Paint to use a core editing engine of Mopaint.
