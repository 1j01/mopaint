# Mopaint

Mopaint is a testing ground for ideas about image editors and editors in general.  
I've previously made many editors\* and, dissatisfied with the status quo of how editors work,
I've begun a quest to improve on it and
[Make **Making** Better][Make Making Better].

As an application,
I want it to be a
***mo**dern*, ***mo**dular*,
***m**obily **o**perable*, ***m**ultiuser **o**nline*
painting app, and ***mo**re!*  

It's also sort of a successor to [JS Paint][],  
without the limiting factor of being first and foremost a recreation of MS Paint from Windows 98,  
on more solid foundations (jspaint's codebase is a mess FYI),  
where I plan to implement things that I feel would be too difficult to implement in that codebase,  
such as (good) collaborative image editing.  
(I may backport some things to JS Paint, and may eventually rewrite JS Paint to use a core editing engine of Mopaint.)  

I'll be focusing on trying to make the tooling around tools really powerful,  
rather than going ahead and making a lot of tools, which would be *easier* and directly useful,  
but add friction to iterating on how tools work as a whole and the process for making them etc.  
That said I might end up creating a significant toolset early on, just because it can be fun and useful,  
and pay the cost in terms of friction to changes (have to update a bunch of tools at once),  
or instability of the toolset (by disabling tools to work on how tools work and progressively adding them back).  

--------

\*Such as [jspaint][JS Paint], [wavey][Wavey], and
[many][Cityship] [many][Chiptool] [many][Tiamblia-original] [many][Skele2D] more.
I've copy-pasted and adapted, or rewritten (often looking at older code as reference),
undo/redo code for new projects, many many times.
I've previously only gone with a very simple undo/redo model where each undo/redo state holds the entire state,
which works fine when the data is simple/small, not so great when it's an image,
altho even that works (computers tend to have a lot of memory these days),
and I've just refined it as such.
This system will be much more advanced, nuanced, etc.
And anyways, having worked on all these different editors,
I've gotten a sense of how editors work\*\* and some of their fundamental problems.

* The copying of the status quo; "follow the leader"; stagnation;
it's entirely reasonable, you want your application to behave similarly to other applications,
so that users can pick up your application easier and faster and use it,
but it's a problem.
And a huge part of it I think is just blindly following what's been done.
Or, *unblindly*, because it's impossible not to form an idea of how things [should] work when you see existing systems.
Not blindly, but unquestioningly.
* Not trying hard enough to minimize the UI (and conceptual) surface,
combine components/elements/ideas and make anything that works with X also apply to Y by making X and Y the same thing.
Do more with less. [Multiism][].
* Once you have some data, there are a million and one things the user might want to do with/to it.
You should e.g. let the user do things in bulk the same way as doing a single thing if possible, if it makes sense.
And many of these things are common between editors (or should be), and could be shared,
so it's worth trying to make libraries for things like undo history,
but things like this are often tied to the data model / store, and you want to have control over that,
and other features are less clear how to librafy and share between applications,
but maybe there should be a free open book/wiki / collection of tutorials for things like data versioning and copy and paste and undo history and things like that and this probably exists but idk
* Lack of [generativity][Generativity].
Running code means dealing with security. (Security is hard.)
And if you're gonna allow code, does that mean your app needs to have a code editor?
Why can't the user use an external editor that already has all the features they want built in and configured?
Why can't they use the language *they* want?
\[as long as it compiles to javascript \[or WebAssembly(?)\]\] ([would be a fine requirement][compile to JS])
This ties into... [Being part of a Modular Design](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html),
Test of Independent Invention ("If someone else had already invented your system, would theirs work with yours?") etc.
I think this problem/these problems are better solved outside of the web, outside of the browser.
That is, I think the browser may be harder to solve these problems in, vs desktop.

Hm, I wasn't planning on typing that much.
It was a short list before I exanded on it.
And I'm not sure why I'm... why I've put this here, or...
Alright, I'm just gonna leave it here, commit, come back to this later.

\*\*I'm not sure what I mean by this exactly.
I mean I obviously know more about the scope of editors,
like I can think of the various UI bits and bobs like ctrl+clicking things that you might expect,
enumerate them, I guess, but what am I getting at here?
Probably something. But I'm tired.

## Crazy (or at least Kooky) Ideas

#### Merging Concepts

What if selections were just layers?  
(what if selections were just layers in a mode? and would it *have* to be a mode?)  
what if you could have hierarchial selections? selections within selections, sublayers of layers?  
what if layers, layer groups, frames of an animation, selections, copy-pastes/duplicates, "smart objects",
[recursive fractal references][Doodal], shapes and brush strokes and other operations - from you or other users, were all the same thing?  
what about masking? that could be the same as a selection, right?

How many of these things are feasible?  
what are the relationships between these objects/concepts?  
are they fundamentally different? (the objects/concepts, or the relationships between them)  
how many of these concepts could feasibly be *merged*, and made more *powerful*?  
what if *anything that works with one thing* worked with the others?  

Frames *could* be the same thing as layers. It can be nice to be limited to drawing individual frames, like a flipbook.  
But I don't think that should be the main way that animation works. (You could do that if you wanted, probably.)  
With animation support, it's inevitable to want features like tweening, objects that persist between frames.  
If you're drawing everything in a form that interpolates between frames, and you record movement thru direct manipulation over time, you don't necessarily need to think about frames.  
(You also might have an animation that plays back at different rates, like for slowmo in a game.)  
If you zoom in to edit motion finely in the context of an object, the basic level of defining motion / variance over time *could* be keyframes, or it *could* be a *function*.  
what if it was a *function*?  

Also, you might want onion skinning over time, as well as over operations or layers.  

If you're doing animation, why not go all out, and allow for *nonlinear* animation?  
(like for games and stuff? interactive stories or whatever?)  
(sprites within games, with state machines, for sure could use a nonlinear timeline)  
(or would it be a time*graph*?)  
Time could be a parameter, and then you could simply have more parameters. Or different parameters.  

What if history was the same thing as layers?  
What if you could rearrange it just the same?  
Both layers and history would cache the latest image.  
And maybe other points within the stack.  

#### Interlude

what if questions questioned *you*?  
what if questions were people *too*?  
what if your quest for questions was quenched?  
what if mine was, would I be benched?  

also what if software worked  
like, what if it was good  

#### Programmability / Generativity

What if documents were reproducible?  
what if they contained all the code for brushes and other tools,  
and all the operations that created it?  
(what if you could edit the application as easily as its contents?)  

What if you could make your own tools really easily?  
what if all the tools were *fully* configurable in their behavior?  
what if most of them were just *presets* of more general tools/functions?  
what if they were *composible*?  
what if there was a *community* of people creating and remixing tools?  

#### Modularity of Document Types

What if you could paint on tessalated/wrapping canvases, infinite canvases, 3D models, etc., all with the same toolset?  

If we implement 3D documents  
(i.e. editing textures on a 3D model,
like [Chameleon][], [Chameleon.js][], [Paint 3D][], [SculptGL][], etc.),  
(actually probably not like Chameleon with its dynamic re-UV-mapping,)  
if it can handle wrapping seamlessly around a cylinder (across triangles, drawing multiply),  
we should be able to do tessalation, wrapping and symetry pretty easily.  
For instance, here's an infinitely zooming set of patterns, in 2D, but made with Three.js: [Infinite Zoom][]
(just imagine texture on those shapes)  

What about 3D painting not just *on* 3D, but *in* 3D?  
like [Tilt Brush][] (a VR thing)  
(or *vaguely* like [Pixelweaver][] (a code-doodling thing))  
I don't think a lot of 2D tools would map so well to 3D,  
and, certainly they'd have a better chance if they had to use a 3D API,  
but idk, what would a flood fill tool be?  
it'd have to use voxelsâ€“or, it wouldn't *have* to, but  
what would it be? what would be the point?  
if you look inside an object your vision is completely occluded?  
maybe it could be useful if joins shapes together that are near together  
anyways, like, an airbrush tool could add dots in a sphere,  
but what about custom tools? idk, should you have to design it with 3D in mind, at its core?  
idk.  
I was thinking, "no, this is totally out of scope" but,  
I'll have to think about it... (in relation to other tools and stuff)...  
what is scope, anyways?  

WHAT IF...  

(let me just do some calculations here)  
350Â°+10Â°=360Â°...  

THREE SIXTY  

NO  
SCOPE  

<!-- this part is weird now considering it's introduced at the top: -->

Actually, I'm combining this idea with [Pixelweaver][]
(another project of mine, focused on reprodubibility),
(and other projects),
and writing a manifesto. [Make **Making** Better][Make Making Better].
Yes, that probably sounds really broad, but I *am* trying to figure out what the scope is.
