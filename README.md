# Mopaint

A revolutionary editing system.

Prototype. Work in progress. Nothing to see yet.

#### Principles

- Holistic design
- Don't destroy data by default.
- Let users explore *fearlessly*.

Don't destroy data by default, only by explicit user action.

Let users explore fearlessly, both the interface, and paths of work.


#### What is in a name?

What might we stand to gain?

- **m**obily **o**perable
- **m**ultiuser **o**nline
- **m**assively **o**penended
- **mo**dern
- **mo**dular
- maybe 3D **mo**deling (**m**ake **o**bjects **p**retty **a**rtistically **in** **t**his thing)
- **mo**tion (animation) (maybe even make full-blown **mo**vies)
- e**mo**tional paintings
- maybe some [custom, dynamic e**mo**ji](https://github.com/multiism/emoji))
- **mo**re!

Mopaint. More than paint.

Mo' painters, mo' fun! Mopaint.

Making [making][Make Making Better] Ossum possum, that's my M.O. That's my modus operandi.  

The file extension could be `.mop`, and it could stand for Mopaint Project,
and/or relate to tools, like a mop. _Mop - ain't_ that great? :P
